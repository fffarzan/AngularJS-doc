>> Two-Way Data Binding (In AngularJS Template):
    1- Procedure:
        a) First the template (which is the uncompiled HTML along with any 
        additional markup or directives) is compiled on the browser.
        b) The compilation step produces a live view.
        c) Any changes to the view are immediately reflected in the model, 
        and any changes in the model are propagated to the view. 
    2- We can think of the view as simply an instant projection of the 
    model.
    3- The controller is completely separated from the view and unaware of 
    it.
